Fulfillment By Amazon (FBA) Reports

There are limits to how often Amazon will generate FBA reports. These limits
depend on whether an FBA report is a near real-time report or a daily report.
See the following table to see which FBA reports are near real-time and which
are daily.

A near real-time FBA report is generated no more than once every 30 minutes.
This means that after a near real-time FBA report is generated following your
report request, a 30-minute waiting period must pass before Amazon will
generate an updated version of that report. Note that the four "All Orders"
reports are not subject to this limitation.

A daily FBA report is generated no more than once every four hours. This means
that after a daily FBA report is generated following your report request, a
four-hour waiting period must pass before Amazon will generate an updated
version of that report.

For more information, see the "Do not request FBA reports more frequently than
they are generated" section of the MWS for FBA Sellers Guide.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Browse Tree Report : _GET_XML_BROWSE_TREE_DATA_

API operation: ManageReportSchedule
API operation: RequestReport

XML report that provides browse tree hierarchy information and node refinement
information for the Amazon retail website in any marketplace.

Can be requested or scheduled. For Marketplace and Seller Central sellers.

This report accepts the following ReportOptions values:

MarketplaceId – Specifies the marketplace from which you want browse tree
information. Optional. If MarketplaceId is not included in the ReportOptions
parameter, the report contains browse tree information from your default
marketplace.

Note: You must be registered as a seller in any marketplace that you specify
using the MarketplaceId value. Also, your request must be sent to an endpoint
that corresponds to the MarketplaceId that you specify. Otherwise the service
returns an error. You can find a list of MarketplaceId values and endpoints in
the "Amazon MWS endpoints and MarketplaceId values" section of the Amazon MWS
Developer Guide.

RootNodesOnly - Type: xs:boolean. Optional. If true, then the report contains
only the root nodes from the marketplace specified using MarketplaceId (or from
your default marketplace, if MarketplaceId is not specified). If false, or if
RootNodesOnly is not included in the ReportOptions parameter, then the content
of the report depends on the value of BrowseNodeId.

BrowseNodeId – Specifies the top node of the browse tree hierarchy in the
report. Optional. If BrowseNodeId is not included in the ReportOptions
parameter, and if RootNodesOnly is false or is not included in the
ReportOptions parameter, then the report contains the entire browse node
hierarchy from the marketplace specified using MarketplaceId (or from your
default marketplace, if MarketplaceId is not specified). Note that if you
include an invalid BrowseNodeId in your request, the service returns a report
that contains no data.

Note: If RootNodesOnly and BrowseNodeId are both included in the ReportOptions
parameter, RootNodesOnly takes precedence.

Note: Amazon recommends that you do not include the MarketplaceIdList parameter
with calls to the RequestReport operation that request the Browse Tree Report.
If there is ever a conflict between a MarketplaceIdList parameter value and the
MarketplaceId value of the ReportOptions parameter, the MarketplaceId value
takes precedence.

To keep track of which browse nodes change over time, Amazon recommends that
each time you request this report you compare it to the last report you
requested using the same ReportOptions values.

URL-encoded example: ReportOptions=MarketplaceId%3DATVPDKIKX0DER;BrowseNodeId%3D15706661

The Browse Tree Report is described by the following XSD: BrowseTreeReport.xsd.

Note: As Amazon updates the Amazon MWS Reports API section, we may update the
BrowseTreeReport.xsd schema. Keep this in mind if you choose to use this schema
for validation. Monitor an Amazon MWS discussion forum for announcements of
updates to the BrowseTreeReport.xsd schema. You can find the Amazon MWS
