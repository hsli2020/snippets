Router design

chi's router is based on a kind of Patricia Radix trie.
The router is fully compatible with net/http.

Built on top of the tree is the Router interface:

// Router consisting of the core routing methods used by chi's Mux,
// using only the standard net/http.
type Router interface {
	http.Handler
	Routes

	// Use appends one or more middlewares onto the Router stack.
	Use(middlewares ...func(http.Handler) http.Handler)

	// With adds inline middlewares for an endpoint handler.
	With(middlewares ...func(http.Handler) http.Handler) Router

	// Group adds a new inline-Router along the current routing
	// path, with a fresh middleware stack for the inline-Router.
	Group(fn func(r Router)) Router

	// Route mounts a sub-Router along a `pattern`` string.
	Route(pattern string, fn func(r Router)) Router

	// Mount attaches another http.Handler along ./pattern/*
	Mount(pattern string, h http.Handler)

	// Handle and HandleFunc adds routes for `pattern` that matches
	// all HTTP methods.
	Handle(pattern string, h http.Handler)
	HandleFunc(pattern string, h http.HandlerFunc)

	// Method and MethodFunc adds routes for `pattern` that matches
	// the `method` HTTP method.
	Method(method, pattern string, h http.Handler)
	MethodFunc(method, pattern string, h http.HandlerFunc)

	// HTTP-method routing along `pattern`
	Connect(pattern string, h http.HandlerFunc)
	Delete(pattern string, h http.HandlerFunc)
	Get(pattern string, h http.HandlerFunc)
	Head(pattern string, h http.HandlerFunc)
	Options(pattern string, h http.HandlerFunc)
	Patch(pattern string, h http.HandlerFunc)
	Post(pattern string, h http.HandlerFunc)
	Put(pattern string, h http.HandlerFunc)
	Trace(pattern string, h http.HandlerFunc)

	// NotFound defines a handler to respond whenever a route could
	// not be found.
	NotFound(h http.HandlerFunc)

	// MethodNotAllowed defines a handler to respond whenever a method is
	// not allowed.
	MethodNotAllowed(h http.HandlerFunc)
}

// Routes interface adds two methods for router traversal, which is also
// used by the github.com/go-chi/docgen package to generate documentation for Routers.
type Routes interface {
	// Routes returns the routing tree in an easily traversable structure.
	Routes() []Route

	// Middlewares returns the list of middlewares in use by the router.
	Middlewares() Middlewares

	// Match searches the routing tree for a handler that matches
	// the method/path - similar to routing a http request, but without
	// executing the handler thereafter.
	Match(rctx *Context, method, path string) bool
}

Each routing method accepts a URL pattern and chain of handlers. 
The URL pattern supports named params (ie. /users/{userID}) and wildcards (ie. /admin/*). 
URL parameters can be fetched at runtime by calling chi.URLParam(r, "userID") for named
parameters and chi.URLParam(r, "*") for a wildcard parameter.

Middleware handlers

chi's middlewares are just stdlib net/http middleware handlers. 
There is nothing special about them, which means the router and all the tooling is 
designed to be compatible and friendly with any middleware in the community.
This offers much better extensibility and reuse of packages and is at the
heart of chi's purpose.

Here is an example of a standard net/http middleware handler using the new request context
available in Go. This middleware sets a hypothetical user identifier on the request context
and calls the next handler in the chain.

// HTTP middleware setting a value on the request context
func MyMiddleware(next http.Handler) http.Handler {
  return http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
    ctx := context.WithValue(r.Context(), "user", "123")
    next.ServeHTTP(w, r.WithContext(ctx))
  })
}
